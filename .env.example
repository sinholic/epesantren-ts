# Database (MySQL)
# IMPORTANT: If your password contains special characters (!, @, #, $, %, &, *, (, ), etc.),
# you MUST URL-encode them. For example:
# - Password: "my@pass#word" → "my%40pass%23word"
# - Or use the DATABASE_URL format: mysql://username:encoded_password@host:port/database
# 
# Common special characters encoding:
# @ = %40, # = %23, $ = %24, % = %25, & = %26, ( = %28, ) = %29, * = %2A, + = %2B, / = %2F, : = %3A, = = %3D, ? = %3F
#
# Example with special characters:
# DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:pass%29word@localhost:3306/db"
# (where %29 is the encoded version of ")" character)
#
DATABASE_URL="mysql://username:password@localhost:3306/database_name"

# JWT Secret (generate a strong random string)
JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key-change-in-production"

# Node Environment
NODE_ENV="development"
